# Tesseract-OCR
# What is Tesseract OCR?
Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is an open-source OCR engine maintained by Google. It's designed to recognize and extract text from images, scanned documents, and other sources.

# Key Features
Accuracy: Tesseract is known for its high accuracy in recognizing text from various sources.

Language Support: It supports a wide range of languages, making it suitable for multilingual applications.

Open Source: Tesseract is freely available and open-source, allowing developers to use, modify, and contribute to its development.

Platform Compatibility: Tesseract is compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Customization: Developers can fine-tune Tesseract's parameters and train it for specific use cases to improve recognition accuracy.

# Usage
Developers commonly use Tesseract OCR for tasks such as:

Extracting text from images, screenshots, and scanned documents.
Automating data extraction from documents for further processing.
Building OCR-based applications for text recognition and analysis.
Integration with GitHub Projects
To integrate Tesseract OCR into GitHub projects:

# Installation:
Install Tesseract OCR on your local development environment or CI/CD pipeline.

Usage: Write scripts or functions to call Tesseract's APIs for text extraction.

Image Preprocessing: Optionally preprocess images to enhance OCR accuracy.

Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with cases where Tesseract fails to extract text accurately.

# Example Code:

from pytesseract import image_to_string

from PIL import Image

Open an image file
 
image = Image.open('example_image.png')

Use Tesseract OCR to extract text

text = image_to_string(image)

Print the extracted text

print(text)
